/// Resolves on-disk URLs stored on a `Book` record, falling back to a
/// sandbox-relative rebase when the absolute URL no longer points at a
/// real file.
///
/// Why this exists: `ImportService` stores absolute file URLs at import
/// time. On iOS, the data container UUID embedded in those URLs is not a
/// stable identity — it can rotate when the system rebuilds the app
/// container (some reinstalls, restored backups, certain device migrations
/// on real devices, and reliably across `simctl install` cycles in the
/// simulator if the bundle is reinstalled rather than updated). When that
/// happens, the SwiftData record survives but the embedded URL is dead,
/// so opening the book throws `ImporterError.malformedEPUB("Cannot open
/// archive: …")` and the reader never loads.
///
/// The rescue: if the stored URL doesn't exist, walk back from the
/// `InkAndEcho` directory name, take the trailing components, and rejoin
/// them onto the *current* Application Support root. The Books directory
/// itself is preserved across reinstalls because Application Support
/// persists with the data container; only the absolute prefix changed.
